## Featured Projects

### [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/tkbarb10/ADS_505_Project.git)
[App Link](https://tkbarb10-ads505-app.hf.space)
The primary problem addressed in this project is: "What characteristics make an Amazon product review helpful?" By leveraging large-scale review datasets, the project seeks to identify linguistic, structural, and contextual features that correlate with helpfulness votes. We had two goals with this project: 

(1) Develop predictive models to identify reviews most likely to be found helpful
(2) Use topic modeling to understand how helpful review characteristics differ by category and rating. 

We hope this helps users write better reviews and enables companies to highlight valuable feedback and gain insights for product or system improvements.
