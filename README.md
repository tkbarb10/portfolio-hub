# My Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! A mantra that has guided my life (implicitly for most of it, explicitly within the last couple years) is **"leverage your curiosity."** I realized my job at the time wasn't cutting it, so I left, hoping that a life immersed in data and technology might scratch the itch. I'm finishing my Masters in Applied Data Science now and so far I'd say it's lived up to the hype! This portfolio hosts a combination of school and personal projects that I've enjoyed most. I'd welcome any collaboration, feedback or ideas for future projects.

## Featured Projects

### What's in a Review?  
**[Project Code](https://github.com/tkbarb10/ADS_505_Project.git) | [Link to App](https://tkbarb10-ads505-app.hf.space)**  
The primary problem addressed in this project is: "What characteristics make an Amazon product review helpful?" By leveraging large-scale review datasets, the project seeks to identify linguistic, structural, and contextual features that correlate with helpfulness votes. We had two goals with this project: 

* **1)** Develop predictive models to identify reviews most likely to be found helpful  
* **2)** Use topic modeling to understand how helpful review characteristics differ by category and rating.  

We hope this helps users write better reviews and enables companies to highlight valuable feedback and gain insights for product or system improvements. I've linked to the project code and the app above. The app walks through the highlights of the project and allows you to upload your own data to explore and use our model on as well.
